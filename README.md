Overview
The Face Match Validator API is a web-based service that enables developers to validate whether faces depicted in submitted images match. We also add predict file if we need to push the code on "www.replicate.com" server for hosting. This API offers a versatile solution with applications spanning across various domains, including:

User Identity Verification: Enhance security by verifying a user's identity for tasks such as unlocking a device or accessing a secure account.

Fraud Detection: Detect and prevent fraud by comparing a photo on a government ID to a live photo of the person presenting the ID.
